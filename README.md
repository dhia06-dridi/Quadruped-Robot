# Quadruped-Robot
 project involves the design and construction of a bionic quadruped robot inspired by a dog, controllable remotely via a mobile application using RemoteXY and an ESP8266 microcontroller. This robot is capable of walking, turning, jumping, and detecting obstacles thanks to synchronized servomotors and an HC-SR04 sensor.
